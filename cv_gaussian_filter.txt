Canny edge detection works in 4 main steps: noise reduction, finding the intensity gradient of the image, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis thresholding.  Noise reduction removes the noise by using a Gaussian filter on the image.  Gaussian filtering consists of a kernel has an x and a y dimension.
