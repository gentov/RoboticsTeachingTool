Finally, simply estimating the pose through comparison is a way to determine an object's pose.  There are systems that compare an input image of the object against a known database of the object at different rotations and translations to estimate the pose.  Unfortunately, the accuracy of these systems is limited as the only estimations that can be done are of specific objects in poses similar to the ones in the database.
