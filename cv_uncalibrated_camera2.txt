Another approach for getting the pose of an object from an uncalibrated camera is to register a CAD model over the photograph of a known object.  This is done by optimizing a suitable distance measure with respect to the pose parameters. This distance measure is calculated between the object in the photograph and the CAD model projection at a given pose.  Depending on the pose representation used, perspective projection or orthogonal projection could be used.
