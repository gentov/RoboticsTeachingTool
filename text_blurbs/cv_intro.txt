Now, we are going to introduce you to computer vision! Computer vision is a burgeoning field in the robotics community because it allows more sensing information. Traditional sensing methods, like LIDAR, only tell a portion of the story. Using RGBD cameras with CV allow for knowledge of the distance of the object, and in-depth processing of the image that allows for the robot to recognize the object.
