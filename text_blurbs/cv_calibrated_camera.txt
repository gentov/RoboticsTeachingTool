If a camera is calibrated with respect to a world coordinate system, and if a 2D image of an object is available, then it is possible to find the pose of the 3D object in its object coordinate system.  Image points are extracted from the 2D image that correspond to corners in an image.  The projection rays from the image points are reconstructed from the 2D (image of the object) points.  The 3D points can be determined from the points that are incident with the reconstructed rays.
