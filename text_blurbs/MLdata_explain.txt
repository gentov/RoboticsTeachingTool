There are two sets of images used in simple machine learning.  These are the testing and training sets, known as testing and training data.  The training data is used to determine weights, and the testing data determines how accurate these weights are. The weights determine how important certain features are.  In a simple ML example, weights could be given to each pixel in an image.  Many ML models are used to classify an image, which means determining if it fits into a certain category.  For example, there are classifiers that determine if a person in an image is smiling or not.  Weights for this model could be used to determine which pixels are most important to determine if a person is smiling.  Higher weights could be seen in pixels on the lower left and right of the image where dimples appear, along with other areas of the image that indicate that the person is smiling.
