As mentioned earlier one of the most important aspects to machine learning is the dataset used.  If the dataset is smaller than needed for a given model, data augmentation can be used to increase the number of training images.  To do this you can flip an already exisiting image in the training set.  All this entails is flipping the matrix across a vertical axis in the middle of the image.  To flip an entire dataset, you can double the amount of training images. In Python that is all_images[:, :, ::-1].  The first colan represents all n images, the second colan is the amount of rows in each (i) image, and the ::-1 represents reversing the column order.  If you wanted to flip the first image horizontally, what would the python code be, using the matrix all_images as the entire dataset, and following the spacing techniques seen above?
