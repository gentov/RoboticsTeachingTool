Uncalibrated Camera:
If a camera is uncalibrated, it is possible to estimate the 3D pose of an object from a single 2D photo, but a 3D model of the object and the corresponding points in the 2D image must be known.  POSIT is an example of an algorithm that estimates the 3D pose of an object.  It estimates the 3D pose directly from the 3D model points (such as a point cloud of the object) and the 2D image points, and iteratively corrects errors until a good estimate is found from a single image.  This algorithm is similar to gradient descent in logic.  One drawback from POSIT is it cannot estimate flat objects or planes but can estimate most 3D objects.
