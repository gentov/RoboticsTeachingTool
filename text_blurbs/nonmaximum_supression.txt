Next, we want to make thinner edges on our image and remove unwanted pixels that aren't part of an edge.  To do this we use non-maximum suppression.  To determine if a pixel is an edge, every pixel is checked to see if it is a local maximum in its neighborhood in the direction of the previously calculated gradient.  

In the example image on the right, point A is on a vertical edge, and the gradient direction is normal to that edge.  Point B and C are in gradient directions; therefore, point A is checked with point B and C to determine if its intensity is drastically different. If so, it is left as an edge in the image, otherwise, it is suppressed, meaning put to zero so therefore removed from the image.
