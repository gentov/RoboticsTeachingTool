Filtering with a kernel works as follows:
The goal of this is to filter is blur the image to reduce high frequency noise by averaging pixels around a center pixel.  We iterate over each pixel in the image, so that each pixel becomes the center pixel around which we average. For each pixel, an n by n grid is centered on the pixel.  Each pixel is replaced with the average values of the pixels around it.  This is known as a mean filter. 
SPACEPLEASE
A gaussian filter uses a kernel, but the kernels values represent the shape of the Gaussian curve.  There is also an additional parameter called sigma, which represents the standard deviation between the pixel values.  By increasing sigma, the image will become more blurry since higher frequencies are more filtered out.
