Computer vision and machine learning often go hand-in-hand but there is a key difference.
Machine learning models perform a task without explicit hard coded instructions.  Instead, they rely on learned models, based on patterns and inferences. Machine learning can use computer vision, as essentially machine learning can help the computer understand what it is seeing.  Computer vision is more than just applied machine learning, as it can involve 3D scene modeeling, structure-from-motion, point cloud processing, motion estimation, and more.
In the next section, we will begin with edge detection, a computer vision processing technique.
