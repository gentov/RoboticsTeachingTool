Projective geometry is "the study of geometric properties that are invariant with respect to projective transformations." Transformations can be expressed by a transformation matrix and translations. "Classic"/Euclidean geometry is not adequate for this situation, since it is not possible to refer to angles in projective geometry in the same was as Euclidean. Projective Geometry is important for Computer Vision as it allows for a 2D image to be transformed into a 3D understanding of the environment, which allows one to calculate the pose (position and orientation) of an object.
