Finally, simply estimating the pose through comparision is a way to determine an objects pose.  There are systems that compare an input image of the object aginst a known database of the object at different rotations and translations to estimate the pose.  Unfortunately the accuracy of these systems are limited as the only estimations that can be done are of specific objects in poses similar to the ones in the database.
