Linear regression is a simple machine learning model used for classification.  In order to understand the linear regression equation, some variables must be explained.  y_hat is the classification of an image, eg, the output of the model.  So for learning if someone is smiling an in image, y_hat could be either 1 or 0, 1 for a smile and 0 for a non smile.   Although the image is 2D, x is a vector used to represent the image.  w is the vector of weights.  Therefore, y_hat = x^T * w.  You can think of the weights as an overlay image that weights the different pixels of x.  That means each pixel in x corresponds with a pixel in w.  On the right is an example of an image, x, and a weight matrix.  Put each of these matrices in vector form and solve for y_hat, which you should enter below.
