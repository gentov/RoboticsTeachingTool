This module mentioned learning models for calculating the pose of an object in a scene were mentioned, which is just one example of how machine learning can be used with computer vision.  Machine learning can be used to train models that identify, or classify, if something is in an image.  For example, you can train a model to determine if a bird is in a tree, given images of trees and birds to train on.  One of the most important things that impact a machine learning model is the set of training and testing images.  Data augmentation, which is a way to transform existing images into scaled, rotated, translated, etc version of the origional image, increases the amount of images in the sets.  This module will investiage a way to classify each image and create additional images.
