Analytic/Geometric methods: 
This method is used when the camera is calibrated with respect to the world coordinate system and the mapping of objects in the 3D scene to the 2D image pixels is known. If the geometry of the object is known, the projected image of the object on the camera image is a known function of the object's pose.  The transformation can be solved once a set of control points on the object are identified (such as corners or unique features).  A transformation is a set of equations which relate the 3D points to the 2D image pixels. Many times, the mapping of the objects in the 3D scene to the 2D image is not known.  This module will explain techniques of determining this mapping for both uncalibrated and calibrated cameras.
