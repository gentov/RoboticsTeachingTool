Filtering with a kernal works as follows:
For each pixel, the window is centered on the pixel, and every pixel that corresponds with a number in the kernal is totalled with all the other pixels that correspond with a spot in the kernal.  That total is then divided by the sum of all the values of the kernal.  That pixel value is then replaced by that divided total.  This process is followed for every pixel in the image.  The gaussian filter approach is different from a standard kernal approach since the kernal does not consist of equal filter coefficients.  There is also a sigma value in x and y.  These sigmas are used to create the values within the kernal.
