The final stage, Hysteresis thresholding, determines which edges are truly edges.  Two threshold values used, minval and maxval.  Any edges that have an intensity gradient greater than maxval are deemed edges, and any edges that have the intensity gradient lower than minval are deemed not edges.  Any pixels in the area in the middle, between minval and maxval, are decided by using the pixels they are connected to. If any of the pixels that they are connected to (therefore part of the same edge) are above maxval, then the connected pixels in the middle are deemed edges.  However if none of the pixels that they are connected to are above maxval, then they are determined to be non-edges.
