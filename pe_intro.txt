Pose estimation of an object is determining rotation and translation transformation of the object from a reference pose to an observed pose. The rotation transformation can be represented as a rotation matrix or a quaternion.  For more information on Rotations, see the Kinematics module.  For Pose estimation there are three main methods: Analytic/Geometric methods, Genetic algorithms, and learning based methods.  This module will investigate the algorithms necessary for the analytic/geometric methods.
