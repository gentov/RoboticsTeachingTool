If the pose of one contour defines the pose of another contour then the following algorithm can be used.

"(a) Reconstruct projection rays from the image points
(b) For each projection ray R:
     (c) For each 3D contour:
          (c1) Estimate the nearest point P1 of ray R to a point on the contour
          (c2) if (n == 1) choose P1 as actual P for the point-line correspondence
          (c3) else compare P1 with P:
                   if dist(P1, R) is smaller than dist(P, R) then
                       choose P1 as new P
(d) Use (P, R) as correspondence set.
(e) Estimate pose with this correspondence set
(f) Transform contours, goto (b)"
